</h3>

| ⚠️  | `three-devtools` is currently in development, You can test the latest [alpha build](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-devtools) if you would like, but be warned, you may find many bugs and incomplete features, and API may be changed. Please file new issues [here](https://github.com/vimcaw/three-devtools/issues) after searching to see if the issue exists. [Contributors welcome](https://github.com/vimcaw/three-devtools/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)! |

# Motivation

[Original three-devtools](https://github.com/threejs/three-devtools) and other `three.js` devtools are feature-lacking, outdated, and lack maintenance. This project aims to provide modern and feature-rich devtools for [three.js](https://threejs.org).

# Usage

## Browser Extension

The browser extension is working in progress.

### Performance Limitation

Browser extension is running in an isolated environment, it can't access the `three.js` objects directly. So we need to inject a script to the page to communicate with the devtools. This will cause a performance penalty, so we recommend using `Embedding Mode`(Can be injected by browser extension or manually initialize) if care about performance.

## Embedding Usage

### Modern Project With Bundling (Vite, Webpack, Rollup, etc.)

#### 1. install `three-devtools` to your project

```bash
// Choose one of the following commands depending on your package manager

npm install three-devtools -D
yarn add three-devtools -D
pnpm add three-devtools -D
```

#### 2. Initialize `three-devtools` in your code

**⚠️ Be cautious, you must make sure that `three-devtools` has been initialized before initializing `three.js`, otherwise `three-devtools` cannot hook three.js correctly.**

##### Option 1: If you want to enable some feature(such as object highlighting on a pick), you have to pass the `THREE` module to the `initialize` method:

```js
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { ThreeJsDevTools } from 'three-devtools';

ThreeJsDevTools.initialize({
  three: THREE,
});
```

##### Option 2: If you don't need those features, you can just call the `initialize` method without passing the `THREE` module:

```js
import { ThreeJsDevTools } from 'three-devtools';

ThreeJsDevTools.initialize();
```

### Legacy Project Without Bundling

It's coming soon.
