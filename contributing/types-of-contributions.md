# Types of contributions :memo:

You can contribute to the [three-devtools](https://github.com/vimcaw/three-devtools) in several ways.

### :mega: Discussions

Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our project, join us in [discussions](https://github.com/vimcaw/three-devtools/discussions).

### :lady_beetle: Issues

[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something wrong about [three-devtools](https://github.com/vimcaw/three-devtools) that should be fixed, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/vimcaw/three-devtools/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests

A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we merge those changes, they should be released in the near future.

### :earth_asia: Translations

We are not ready to support translation contributions at this time. We are working on a plan to support translations in the future, and we will update this section when we have more information.
