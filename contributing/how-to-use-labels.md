### Labels

Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with.

- The [`help wanted` label](https://github.com/vimcaw/three-devtools/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) is for problems or updates that anyone in the community can start working on.
- The [`good first issue` label](https://github.com/vimcaw/three-devtools/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.
