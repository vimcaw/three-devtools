### Self review

You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:

- [ ] Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the content design plan (if there is one).
- [ ] Make sure anything you changed works well.
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.
